## 2D real time Raytracer

### *How to compile:*
Have SDL and Makefile installed and then run `make exe`

This project is a 2D Raytracer with a simple procedural world generation using the Simplex noise library FastNoiseLite

Once you have run the program, use the keyboard arrows to move around,
You can zoom In (with I) and out (with O)
And finally, you can rotate the camera with E and Q (A if you have an AZERTY keyboard)
